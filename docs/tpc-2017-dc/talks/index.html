<p>Dates and times are confusing and crazy. What nut invented Daylight Saving Time? Someone who'd never imagined a computer, that's who!</p>

<p>Dealing with dates and times might seem simple at first, but there's a lot of gotchas.</p>

<p>This talk will start by covering some concepts worth knowing about (What is an Olson timezone? What's the Gregorian Calendar?).</p>

<p>After that we'll talk about how the DateTime suite of modules can make your life a little easier. I'll show you some best practices for working with dates and times, and highlight some gotchas in DateTime's API, and with datetimes in general.</p>

<p>Swift was originally released in 2014, and Open Sourced by Apple in late 2015. The Open Source release generated an explosion of community interest and support, resulting in ports to other platforms and significant language changes. Swift version 3, which reflects the results of much of this work, was released in September of 2016, bringing with it some significant refinements to the core language and a new package manager.</p>

<p>Swift is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming styles. The language is strongly typed but has extensive support for type inference and substantial tooling available in XCode to identify and in some cases automatically fix common programming errors. Swift uses a memory management strategy called automatic reference counting (ARC), freeing programmers from the tedium of manually managing memory allocation. This combination of strong typing, maximal type inference, automatic reference counting (ARC), and excellent tooling results in an experience that can be described as "the Macintosh of programming languages".</p>

<p>This talk will present some of the history of the development of Swift with emphasis on how the Open Source release of the language kick-started activity, review the basic syntax of Swift (with comparisons to similar languages that attendees may be more familiar with), and describe what tools are available to help learn the language, including XCode, the Swift REPL available from XCode, and the new Swift Playgrounds for iPad that debuted with Swift 3 and iOS10. After attending this talk, an attendee with no previous Swift experience will understand exactly why they should be excited about this relatively new programming language and be up to date on exactly what they need to do to dive into Swift coding for themselves.</p>

<p>This fairly meta talk discusses a bubbling practice of civic engagement, or 'civic hacking' to solve local problems that local government or local business neglect.  It may also help solve a problem Perl has been facing, as a community, and that's in encouraging new blood to join our ranks... to ensure there's demand for perl developers in our ecosystem.  A small panel, well-represented by community members and USPTO staff, all participants in the local 'CodeForAmerica' chapter 'CodeForNoVA', will discuss the issue and invite conversation from the room.</p>

<p>My Vim config now totals over 75,000 lines of VimScript.
That's utter madness, of course. But there is method in it.</p>

<p>About 1/3 of those lines are specifically aimed at helping me write, maintain, navigate, and test my Perl code. My Vim configuration now automatically loads file templates, highlights syntax errors in realtime, intelligently searches for documentation, autocompletes syntactic constructs with snippet-like placeholders, autoaligns key/value lists, wraps long lines much more readably, summarizes subroutines, tracks and explains variables, searches and helps navigate source files across multiple directories, finds and executes module test suites, colour-codes STDOUT and STDERR, and even autoselects the right version of Perl for each program.</p>

<p>In this talk I'll explain how my .vimrc does all this, and show you how to obtain and configure the various Vim plugins and Perl modules that make it possible.</p>

<p>Parsing is the task of analyzing unstructured inputs, such as character strings, and transforming them into structured data, such as databases or hierarchies. Nearly every program has to parse input. Perl provides some built-in operators for parsing, but they go only so far. And although CPAN contains several excellent parsing modules, most are fundamentally limited.</p>

<p>In this class, we will see how to build a parsing system that is unlimited in extent. The basic idea is to construct modular tools that can assemble simple parsers into more complex ones. When complex parsers are built from simple components, parsing code is powerful, flexible, and maintainable. Parsers are written directly in Perl, not in a separate language. Some tools are generic, and are useful in building nearly any parser, but we'll also see how to build special-purpose parser-constructing tools as we need them to solve parsing problems that are specific to an application. Topics will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building lexers and emulating Perl's '<FH>' operator</li>
<li>Very simple parsers</li>
<li>Writing functions to combining simple parsers into more complex ones</li>
<li>Recursive descent</li>
<li>Case study: parsing regular expressions</li>
<li>Case study: parsing outlines and trees</li>
<li>Parsers that diagnose and recover from erroneous input</li>
<li>Backtracking</li>
<li>Operator overloading</li>
</ul>

<p>This tutorial requires a separate $75 ticket.</p>

<p>Modern programming languages have a wide spectrum of error handling methods and related cultural expectations.   </p>

<p>I'll lead you on a brief tour of various error handling patterns and paradigms and their strengths and failings.  As a polyglot dabbler, I've done just enough with each of these languages to have formed cranky opinions.</p>

<p>By the end, we'll have new patterns to apply to our perl code (be in perl5 or perl6).</p>

<p>Compare and contrast:</p>

<ul>
<li>C inspired return values in C, perl5 and go</li>
<li>Java vs Python exceptions</li>
<li>Erlang: "let it crash" approach,  </li>

<p>I had been lately hearing a bit about, but never studied, robotics more generally, and autonomous driving in particular and wondered if I could create some smaller instance of this using commodity tools - something like an inexpensive remote controlled car - purchased off the shelf, by using sensors (a camera) on the device, and having input from the camera be used to navigate the device, in "real-time," so to speak. In this talk I discuss my experiences and detail a bit about the code, various algorithms investigated, and other things I tried along the way.</p>

In this talk, Jason explains why he spent a year writing a web application instead of writing a book, why making one dang webpage took a whole year (government agencies are involved), and the hopes and uncertainties that lie in the project's future (government agencies are involved).</p>

<p>Maybe he should have written a book after all. Well, whatever, he did this anyway, and he's going to talk about it. Come hear him talk about the rewards of asking people for stuff nicely, and the pitfalls of writing software that's only useful for doing a thing that you're normally too scared to do very much.</p>

<p>Look, he's already written two books and that's all behind him now, okay?</p>

<p>Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is one of those dry, abstract governmental issues that has powerful effects on how we live. TIF was originally conceived to promote economic development in marginalized areas. But is YOUR tax money supporting projects like low-income housing, homeless shelters, and drug rehabilitation clinics? Or are YOUR tax dollars being spent on kickbacks to developers of high income apartments and condos?</p>

<p>I live in Nebraska. I'll show you how we took years of Excel spreadsheets and normalized the data into an SQLite database, and then generated a static website which we hope will help people decide whether or not they're happy with how their tax dollars are being spent.</p>

<p>The biggest problem in a large data processing system is how to organize it: Where are the scripts? Where's the configuration? How can the scripts share code and configuration? How do we turn our ad-hoc data processing scripts into a cohesive data platform?</p>

<p>The Beam framework consists of tools for integrating systems, no matter what Perl libraries you're using. Beam::Wire provides a powerful configuration file for sharing information. Beam::Runner provides organization and discovery for data scripts. And Beam::Minion provides a scalable compute cluster using the Minion task engine. With these tools, you can build a flexible, maintainable data processing system, or start better organizing your existing data processing system.</p>

<p>The CPAN testers network is an amazing outgrowth of Perl's "tesing culture". Authors get their modules tested on hundreds of O/S and Perl platform combinations. Setting up and managing a machine dedicated to testing can be difficult, however, even a virtual machine requires a lot of extra work to keep running. Docker (containers in general) provide an alternative: all it requires is the shared libraries for Perl and a way to import CPAN modules for tesing. The ability to manage resources and suspend/restart the containers also makes this nice for background work on larger systems.</p>

<p>This talk discusses the basics of setting up the CPAN testers code in a docker container and running the test cycle for in-house testing or as part of the general tester's network.</p>

<p>If you haven't been paying attention to javascript (and I can entirely
understand why you might prefer not to), things have changed quite amazingly
over the last few years.</p>

<p>Ok, they got 'use strict' years ago - but now they've added 'let', which is
basically 'my', anonymous function declaration syntax that won't give you
RSI, a class keyword, and more.</p>

<p>Plus annotations now let you make all sorts of trouble, and the tooling to
transpile to Olde JS is mostly comprehensible and no longer replaced by
something completely different every two weeks.</p>

<p>So, clearly, the only sensible thing to do was to try and write ES6 in the
same style I write perl5, and see how far I managed to get.</p>

<p>Perl 6 has amazing built-in features for writing command-line utilities.  But sometimes even those aren't enough.  In this talk, we push it further to allow features such as subcommands, command-specific help and interleaved positional and named arguments.  We use metaprogramming to look up dispatch tables for multi-candidates, scrutinize signatures, and query POD declarator blocks.  We show how integration with command line argument parsing is a practical application of Perl 6's rich meta-object protocol.</p>

<p>It's well-known that Perl resembles
languages used in the Unix sysadmin community, such as C, Bourne shell, awk, and sed. Perl programmers tend to come from
that community, or to have been trained by people who did.</p>

<p>Perhaps you've heard the joke that a dedicated Fortran programmer can write Fortran programs in any language. But Perl programmers have been writing C programs in Perl for years without realizing it. This class will show you how to effectively use some of Perl's most powerful features to do
organize your programs more powerfully and effectively.</p>

<p>I've raided the techniques of the Lisp and functional programming communities and come back with all the loot I can carry, techniques for increasing modularity and interoperability on large projects.</p>

<p>We'll take recursion to the next level and see how to build powerful recursive functions for managing hierarchical data. We'll see how callbacks, usually relegated to GUI programming, can be used to increase modularity in your library functions, so that they can be used in ways you didn't expect, by programmers years later, without anyone having to change or even look at your code. We'll look in detail at how to provide 'function factories' that manufacture, on demand, the library functions that the user needs. We'll see how objects based on anonymous functions can be used to get around some of the limitations of Perl's built in OOP system. We'll see how to make your own filehandle-like objects that generate data on demand.</p>

<p>The publicly visible part of the Perl 5 codebase consists of the Perl 5 core distribution and the totality of all the libraries on CPAN.  We assess the health of the codebase via testing:  smoke-testing of Perl 5 blead and CPANtesters testing of new CPAN releases on a wide variety of versions of Perl and of operating systems.</p>

<p>But what happens when the code is not so healthy or when we need to provide preventative care?  How well are our tools suited for that purpose?</p>

<p>In this presentation we'll discuss the current state of Perl 5 smoke testing, testing of CPAN libraries and the mysterious land between them known as "Blead Breaks CPAN."  We'll see some of the challenges which the Perl 5 Porters face in moving the core language forward without causing major problems for CPAN libraries and other users.  And we'll introduce some ideas for improvements in the ways we maintain the health of the ecosystem.</p>

This session will explain the differences between patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and illustrate how those legal tools can be applied to a piece of software to achieve different business goals. It will also discuss common open source licenses, and explain the legal consequences those licenses have for software development and commercialization.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Moose</h2> Full Day Tutorial, Intermediate

</h3>

<p>This is an interactive hands-on course all about Moose, an OO system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of “sugar” on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.</p>

<p>With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose’s features include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and coercions, method modifiers (“before”, “after”, and “around”), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.</p>

<p>This course covers Moose’s core features, goes in depth on many of them, and explores some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available on CPAN.</p>

<p>This is a hands-on course. Each lecture section is followed by a hands-on exercise section where you put what you’ve just learned into practice. The instructor will work with each student individually as needed to help you get the most from these exercises.</p>

<p>This class is aimed at Perl programmers who understand object-oriented programming and want to learn how to do it with Moose. It is not suitable for Perl beginners or for people without any OO experience. OO experience in other languages besides Perl is sufficient, as long as you also have a good grasp of Perl syntax, particularly method call syntax.</p>

<p>Students are expected to bring a laptop with a recent version of Perl and the editor of their choice. You will also be expected to clone the class’s git repository in order to obtain a copy of the class slides and exercises.</p>

<p>More information about the course is available here: http://www.houseabsolute.com/classes/</p>

<p>This tutorial requires a separate $150 ticket.</p>

<p>This talk will focus on the need for, process of, and impact of developing custom software and data systems for scientists.  My aim is to give you a glimpse into the rewarding world of software in science by drawing from concrete examples in own my experience of building systems using Perl, Python, JavaScript, Elm, and many other languages.  For over three years now I've been the staff programmer in a biology research lab at the University of Washington, and I'll share what I've learned along the way after making the jump from commercial software development.</p>

<p>This talk is about adding logging and reporting to your Perl project. Every program, from the smallest script to the largest distributed platform needs to tell you what's going on inside, even if only temporarily. I'll go through how to add logging and reporting to scripts to aid debugging and enable problem analysis. I'll explain how different logging can be used for different purposes, show how the Log::Any module makes it easy to add a basic logging system powerful enough for most common cases, and go through some different ways to transmit and store logs for later exploration and reporting (like Syslog and ElasticSearch).</p>

<p>There are a lot of great things about the cloud, but the "destroy and rebuild" philosophy which is really good for building a continuous delivery pipeline, really sucks when applied to troubleshooting production problems. When your application goes haywire, the most valuable engineering skill is not the the ability to bring up a copy of your system or even the knowledge of a your technology stack (although it doesn't hurt).  It is the skill of understanding and solving problems.</p>

<p>Finding the root cause of the issue and mitigating it with minimal disruption in production is a must-have skill for engineers responsible for managing and maintaining production systems. In this talk I will discuss the skills required to troubleshoot complex systems, traits that prevent engineers from being successful at troubleshooting and discuss some techniques and tips and trick for troubleshooting complex systems in production.</p>

While his core expertise is in Perl and application development in general, he works his way around the whole technology stack from system architecture to databases design and code optimization. He's considered a professional naysayer by peers and has the opinion that nothing really works until it works for at least a million people.</p>

<p>With Tau Station, we're building a sci-fi universe in a browser. However, in object oriented design, what does the "single responsibility principle" mean when your combat armor serves as armor, a weapon, and medkit?</p>

<p>And when many different behaviors have long chains of duplicated requirements (for example, do you have enough money to buy a medkit, or refuel your ship, or repair your blaster, or bribe a guard), how do you handle that in an efficient an easy to read manner?</p>

<p>And how do you avoid god objects when your character in the universe drives almost everything?</p>

<p>This talk explores some of the techniques we've developed for the Tau Station to easily model complex behaviors.</p>

<p>Perl 5.10 added more useful features to the language than any other release since Perl 5.0.0. Perls 5.12 through 5.24 are more recent annual releases that provide important refinements and further enhancements. Perl 5.26 is the next scheduled release, due in mid-2017. Most people are now using Perl 5.10 or later, but often without taking advantage of those new features.</p>

<p>This one-day tutorial provides a detailed introduction to the new and improved features of these modern versions of Perl 5, along with practical examples of how they can improve the performance, robustness, and maintainability of your code.</p>

<p>Topics covered include:</p>

<p>Backward and forward compatibility using the feature pragma
Smartmatching comparisons
Perl's new switch statement
Many new features and performance improvements for regular expression
State variables
Lexical subroutines
Handling defaults with the defined-or operator
New and improved file and filetest operations
Recursive sorting and pattern matching
The new UNITCHECK execution phase
The extended package definition syntax
Implicit strictures
Using each on arrays
Using array or hash references in place of arrays or hashes
Much more reliable exception handling
New and improved core modules and pragmas
New documentation
Deprecations and feature removals
Where to expect better (or worse!) performance</p>

<p>So, you don't have time to read Damian Conway's "Perl Best Practices" book, to understand his "256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code"? Hear Randal Schwartz provide the executive summary, including pointing out where Randal disagrees with Damian, and why. This high-speed overview will help you understand "code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging." But using shorter words. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/RandalSchwartz/perl-best-practices-v4">Course material available for download</a> </p>

<p>When learning a new language, some folks prefer to read the language documentation, or work through simple exercises like you might find on http://exercism.io -- but I prefer to have something more like an actual project. I find that holds my focus a little better, and that I do a better job of absorbing the new language syntax and features if I'm using them for something <em>real</em>.</p>

<p>This 1 day tutorial will introduce you to the features of the Perl language while walking you through writing a static site generator. We'll start simply by opening, reading, and writing files, but over the course of the day we'll cover processing directories full of files, selecting and using a templating system, supporting Markdown, implementing a simple weblog, and much more.</p>

<p>This tutorial is aimed at people who have some programming experience in another language. No Perl experience will be required or assumed.</p>

<p>This tutorial requires a separate $50 ticket.</p>

<p>For this year's talk I'll be demoing the brand new RapidApp-based blogging platform Rapi::Blog which has been under development for around 6 months so far (as of march). It will be debuting with its first public release on CPAN on the day of the talk! Folks, this is conference-driven development at its finest.</p>

<p>Previous years' RapidApp talks have also involved day-of, first-time releases of demo applications, but this year is different in that Rapi::Blog is first and foremost a real application and is designed for real-world use. </p>

<p>Another blog?!?? Yep. And, like the countless other devs that came before me - who broke-down and said "screw it, I'll just write my own blog" - I went down the rabbit hole because I wanted some set of features and functionality that I couldn't find in other platforms. Everyone has different priorities, but for me, the two main factors were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Truer abstraction and separation between the front-end "theme" and the backend</li>
<li>Leveraging the features and flexibility of RapidApp </li>
</ol>

<p>Rapi::Blog introduces a new "scaffold" pattern which consists of a file structure of template-driven, pure HTML/CSS documents that are able to represent the view and layout for a given site using a straightforward but comprehensive API of template directives. The intent is to reduce the translation effort needed to convert a static, font-end only html site (such as a bootstrap site/template) to be driven from dynamic, backend models. The blog pattern emerges from a content model (i.e. posts, comments, etc, standard blog features) and a scaffold of html templates, css and images which accesses it.</p>

<p>Since it's powered by RapidApp, the initialization of the storage model is all automatic and requires virtually nothing for a new site/instance (unless you want to customize the model, which you can). In this way, a Rapi::Blog installation is able to consist of nothing but a scaffold and a place to store data. It is then the scaffold that can be extended, customized and adapted to create all kinds layouts, designs and scenarios. That said, Rapi::Blog will also ship with a fully-working vanilla-design scaffold needed to function as a blog.</p>

<p>If you want to try another blog with maximalist features but minimalist effort, or, if you just want to see my/RapidApp's take on the blog question, this talk is for you. Just like previous RapidApp talks, this one will consist of all live-running, real-time demos (which you can run yourself), and should be a lot of fun. </p>

<p>Sometimes, when writing a test, you don't have to opportunity to do dependency injection of the type of transport used in a specific API. Sometimes that code will unequivocally always use actual HTTP and the only control you have is over the host and port to which it will connect.</p>

<p>Have you ever put a value into a JavaScript variable, and then been unable to use it where you needed it? Or created it and unintentionally overridden something you thought wouldn't be affected? JavaScript has an unusual way of handling where variables are available, we call this "where" a scope. In this talk, we'll go over how JavaScript variables 'bubble' up into higher scopes, how to restrict them to just where you want them, and how this affects variables in your functions. </p>

<p>A “character” can mean different things to different people, but the largest disparity is between applications and the humans who use them. Programmers aren’t to blame, as our programming languages, libraries, and databases provide little or no support for understanding user-perceived characters. Many systems disagree on the basic units of characters, some use code points, others use code units, and others still operate on individual bytes by default. This frequently leads to products with a poor experience in some users’ languages, especially written languages that use grapheme clusters, sequences of code points that compose a single user-perceived character. With the rise in global emoji usage and the rapid evolution of standard emoji sequences, this problem is increasingly experienced by users worldwide, regardless of their language.</p>

<p>This session will cover:
• Extended grapheme clusters and emoji sequences
• Programming with these user-perceived characters
• Data input, parsing, analysis, formatting, and output
• Setting product requirements for character support
• Examples from Shutterstock’s platforms for content editing and collaboration</p>

<p>All I wanted was to add three extra words to Perl's syntax.
    How hard could that be?</p>

<pre><code>In the end, it required:

    * three years, 2.8 million lines of code
    * five nested development projects,
    * 3633 CPAN modules,
    * 498405 unit tests,
    * the four most perfectly obfuscated Perl programs of all time,
    * multiple multi-layered multiple-dispatch systems,
    * a 1011-line substitution statement,
    * a 1194-line regex match
    * an entirely new meta-meta-metasyntax

This is a tale of madness, obsession, and coding extremity.
This is a journey to the very heart of Perl...and beyond.
In three little words.

<p>All of us have written command line scripts in Perl. This talk aims to share some insight into writing tools others can use. We'll venture down some best practices and take a peak at a few really useful modules on the CPAN and how to use them. We'll look at CLI::Helpers, a library I'm maintaining and make heavy use of on a daily basis for simplifying common tasks you and your users need.</p>

<p>Most scientists write bad software. This software can sometimes be improved with programming best practices. However, programming best practices do not help with data analysis software, the code that transforms the raw experimental data into digestible results, tables, and figures. Often, the most important results are not immediately obvious, only emerging after a period of exploratory analysis. This highly dynamic process involves pruning and sharpening, abandoning and starting fresh, and returning to a previously abandoned approach. Multiple lines of analysis from one stage serve as the starting point of the next. Test suites are a premature optimization, yet bugs sneak in and are discovered only in later stages. Over the last few years I have developed a modulino-based approach for managing this unusual set of challenges and constraints. In this talk, I will show the many inefficient approaches scientists use, how conventional software practices don't help, and how Perl's quirks make it easy to solve this problem with just a little bit of creativity and discipline.</p>
