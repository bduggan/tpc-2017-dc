<p>When you purchase your ticket, there are a lot of non-refundable things that we need to buy in order to prepare for your arrival, such as food. Some of these things need to be ordered several weeks prior to the event.</p>

<p>Cancellations that occur 15 days prior to the start of the first event or earlier will be eligible for a full refund. Cancellations that occur between 14 and 6 days prior to the first event will receive a 50% refund.

<p>In order to apply, please scan your identification card and email it along with a written request to <a href="mailto:admin@perlconference.us">admin@perlconference.us</a>. If your card includes a social security number or other private identification numbers, please blank that portion out. We only want to know that the ID is current and issued to you. You may be asked to produce the identification card again at check-in.</p>

<p>Space is limited, so requests will be considered on a first-come, first-serve basis. Upon acceptance, you will receive a coupon code that may be used to purchase an event pass for $50.</p>

<h2>Speaker Pass</h2>

<p>Speakers with an accepted talk of at least 20 minutes in length will receive a non-transferable promo code for registration to the main event for free. If you don't end up giving the talk we'll convert it to a regular ticket at the regular price.</p>

<h2>Volunteer Pass</h2>

<p>Individuals willing to commit to assisting with the conference may receive a non-transferable promo code redeemable for one pass to the main event. Volunteers must commit to providing a minimum of 16 hours of volunteer service during the event. Volunteer by contacting <a href="mailto:admin@perlconference.us">admin@perlconference.us</a>.</p>

<h2>Sponsor Pass</h2>

<p>Sponsors of The Perl Foundation are entitled to a certain number of free passes to the conference, depending on their sponsorship package. Sponsoring organizations must be in good standing with their sponsor payments to The Perl Foundation. Sponsor passes may only be used by employees or immediate family of employees of the sponsoring organization. Sponsor passes are not transferable. Each sponsoring organization will receive one promo code that may be used to register all of their staff. Sponsoring organizations will be invoiced at the standard pass rate for any registrations made with their promo code in excess of their allotment.</p>

<p>Each sponsoring organization will also receive a certain number of invitations to the sponsor dinner. Not all sponsor pass holders will be able to attend the sponsor dinner.</p>

<h2>Exhibitor Pass</h2>

<p>Individuals that are only participating in the sponsor expo may receive a complimentary exhibitor pass. Exhibitor passes are not authorized to attend talks or other events at (unless your organization is directly sponsoring that event.)</p>

<h2>Press Pass</h2>

<p>Accepted press applicants will receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>A complimentary pass to attend the event.</li>
<li>Access to request interviews with key figures within the Perl Foundation organization and Perl community. Due to time restraints, we cannot guarantee direct interviews. However, the sooner we have your request, the sooner we can pass it along.</li>
<li>Access to the conference’s hotel room rates, provided that rooms reservations are made by the published deadlines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accepted press applicants are expected to:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least one month in advance of the conference’s start date, or as soon as your are accepted, provide relevant media coverage of your intent to attend the event. This should include conference dates, location, website, and an aspect of the conference you plan on covering.</li>
<li>Abide by The Perl Foundation’s Standards of Conduct throughout the entirety of the event. You will need to have a signed copy on file with the conference staff.</li>
<li>At the conclusion of the event, share highlights of the event via a relevant media channel. If announced at the conclusion of the event, please include relevant information for the following year’s conference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to provide meaningful media coverage of the event or violating The Perl Foundation’s Standards of Conduct may result in dismissal from the conference, an invoice to recover the event’s standard registration costs, and revocation of press privileges for future Perl Foundation events.</p>

<p>In order to prevent abuse of these benefits we reserve the right to review each applicant to ensure the media coverage and audience is appropriate for the benefit of the Perl community. If you wish to apply for a press pass, please contact <a href="mailto:admin@perlconference.us">admin@perlconference.us</a>.</p>

<h2>Key Staff Pass</h2>

<p>Key staff will meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must volunteer a minimum of 8 hours per day at the conference.</li>
<li>The volunteer’s role is vital to The Perl Conference. The job could not be broken down such that multiple people could fulfill pieces of it. The absence of that particular assigned person would hurt the conference.</li>
<li>The volunteer should have had significant time invested in pre-conference activities. Examples include but not limited to: attending planning meetings, communicating with the community, or making arrangements that are vital to the event.
Key staff will be provided with a pass, a hotel room for the duration of their role in the event, and reasonable travel expenses. Determinations on qualification for Key Staff will be made by The Perl Foundation.</li>
</ul>
